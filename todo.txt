//TO DO FOR DUNA
	get ike encounter and deploy at edge of duna SOI
	Then download startup script to lander in case no signal
	change periapsis to calculated braking altitude (probably <9km?)
	deploy lander
	deploy orbiter
	set orbiter PE to greater than atmo
	arrange orbiter capture burn
	


// write individual science scripts for duna craft
	should have separate functions for resuable science
	function for once only science


// 		to add to boot script
	first run check logic
		checks for file (need to write file checking function)
		if file is there jump to proceed
		
		Else //is not there then 
			//write file (notfirstrun)
			// do science module check (grabmodules.ks)
			//writes science checker (or download large universal science runner)
			do RT check (create RT master list. reference from grabmodules)
			RT Setup (leaves RTisSetup file for later reference)
			housecleaning (delete non-used files)
		//end
